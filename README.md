This website is a frontend implementation of an e-commerce responsive site. It is composed of 3 files that are under "./src". 

It can be viewed [here](https://finalproject-vanilajs.netlify.app/)

However, if one wants to run it directly in local-host, please download this entire folder (FINALPROJECT). You'll need to have MAMP installed in your computer, please refer [here](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/)

After this, you need to start your local server and go to the htdocs folder that is inside the MAMP aplication. Then, copy and paste the entire (FINALPROJECT) folder into htdocs. After this, you need to enter to localhost on your web browser and write the path to the file that usually would be: localhost:[port]/FinalProject/src/index.html
